# Album API Project
For this project, I created an express API that users can use to log music albums from their own collection. This API uses express to access a user database via routes for creating, updating, deleting, showing a specific / all, and logging in / out users. The API also accesses an album database through routes for creating, updating, deleting, and showing a specific / all albums within the database, according to the user.
